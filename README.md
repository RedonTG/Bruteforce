# Bruteforce

This Python script attempts to brute-force login credentials for a specified URL by trying multiple passwords from a given list. It sends HTTP requests to a login page with the provided username and each password from a file, stopping if it finds the correct password.

# Key Features
Username and Password-Based Login Attempts: Enter a target URL, a username, and a password file to try different combinations.
Customizable Failure Detection: Define a specific string that appears in the page response when login fails (e.g., "Invalid login").
Cookie Support: Accepts an optional cookie to handle sessions if needed.
Color-Coded Output: Displays login attempts in red and successful login credentials in green for easy visibility.

## Warning: This script is for educational and authorized testing purposes only. Unauthorized usage of brute-force techniques is illegal and can lead to serious consequences.
